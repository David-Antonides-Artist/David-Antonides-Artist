- 👋 Hi, I’m @David-Antonides-Artist, I'm a 63 year-old visual artist and a Canadian living in Berlin now for ten years.
- 👀 I’m interested in using GAN or AI of some kind to creatively interact and explore the outcome of an iterative collaboration. Perhaps I could submit progressive iterations as a third part of the GAN process?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project which we would attempt the first steps to learn my style and techniques to realize "authentic artworks" and perhaps it would lead us to new visual directions in practice. Or could a machine continue my artistic process after I am gone? 
- My programming skills are very limited - using linux and simple databases. I have had quite a lot of experience with electronic circuitry and am open to learn. I have a lifetime of visual art that could be used as input material.
- 📫 How to reach me ...GANart@davidantonides.com
