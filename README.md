- 👋 Hi, I’m @David-Antonides-Artist 63 year-old visual artist, a Canadian living in Berlin for ten years.
- 👀 I’m interested in using GAN or AI of some kind to creatively interact and explore the outcome of an iterative collaboration. 
perhaps I could submit progressive iterations as a third part of the GAN process?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project which would attempt the first steps to learn my style and techniques to realize "authentic fakes" and perhaps 
lead to new directions in my practice.
- My programming skills are very limited - using linux and simple databases. I have had quite a lot of experience with electronic circuitry and am open to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me ...GANart@davidantonides.com
